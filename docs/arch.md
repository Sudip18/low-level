# Architecture

In order to run some software you need a real machine and
real machines come with a great variety of architecture

## Assembler

There are two notations: **Intel** and **AT&T**.

## AMD64

1. User-level applications use as integer registers for passing the sequence %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8 and %r9. The kernel interface uses %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %r10, %r8 and %r9.
2. A system-call is done via the syscall instruction. The kernel destroys registers %rcx and %r11.
3. The number of the syscall has to be passed in register %rax.
4. System-calls are limited to six arguments, no argument is passed directly on the stack.
5. Returning from the syscall, register %rax contains the result of the system-call. A value in the range between -4095 and -1 indicates an error, it is -errno.
6. Only values of class INTEGER or class MEMORY are passed to the kernel.
